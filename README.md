BlueO
----------

BlueO is one of my first experiments with this wonderful CSS framework Inuit.css made by Harry Roberts.

<h3>BlueO.scss</h3>

I have custom styled some of the html elements like : 
headings, blockquotes, tables, buttons, forms as a base for making my own really simple Interfaces.

<h3>Using BlueO on Inuit.css </h3>
Harry has explained it beautifully on <a href="webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/rubbing-noses-with-inuit-css/">tutsplus</a>.
Include blueo.scss in the CSS folder to make it running.
