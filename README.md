BlueO
=============

BlueO is one of my first experiments with this wonderful CSS framework Inuit.css made by Harry Roberts.

BlueO.scss
=============

I have custom styled some of the html elements like : 
headings, blockquotes, tables, buttons, forms as a base for making my own really simple Interfaces.

Using Inuit.css
=============
Harry has explained it beautifully on : webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/rubbing-noses-with-inuit-css/
Include blueo.scss in the CSS folder to make it running.
